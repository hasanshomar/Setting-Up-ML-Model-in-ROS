# Create Image Processing Node 
---

### **Step 1: Create the Image Processing Node Script**

1. **Navigate to Your Package Directory**:
   - Move into the package directory where you'll create the script:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test/src/image_processor_test/image_processor_test
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script**:
   - Inside the `image_processor_test` directory, create a new directory called `scripts` if it doesnâ€™t exist, and then create a Python script named `image_publisher.py`:

   ```bash
   mkdir scripts
   cd scripts
   touch image_publisher.py
   ```

3. **Write the Image Publishing Script**:
   - Open the `image_publisher.py` file with your preferred text editor:

   ```bash
   gedit image_publisher.py
   ```

   - Add the following code to the script:

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import os
   import time
   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
   from cv_bridge import CvBridge
   import cv2

   class ImagePublisher(Node):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__('image_publisher')
           self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(Image, 'image_topic', 10)
           self.bridge = CvBridge()
           self.image_dir = '/path/to/your/image_directory'  # Update with your directory
           self.image_files = sorted(os.listdir(self.image_dir))  
           self.current_index = 0
           self.timer_period = 1.0  # seconds
           self.timer = self.create_timer(self.timer_period, self.timer_callback)

       def timer_callback(self):
           if self.current_index < len(self.image_files):
               image_path = os.path.join(self.image_dir, self.image_files[self.current_index])
               cv_image = cv2.imread(image_path)
               ros_image = self.bridge.cv2_to_imgmsg(cv_image, "bgr8")
               self.publisher_.publish(ros_image)
               self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing {self.image_files[self.current_index]}')
               self.current_index += 1
           else:
               self.get_logger().info('All images processed.')
               self.timer.cancel()

   def main(args=None):
       rclpy.init(args=args)
       image_publisher = ImagePublisher()
       rclpy.spin(image_publisher)
       image_publisher.destroy_node()
       rclpy.shutdown()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
   ```

   - Make sure to replace `'/path/to/your/image_directory'` with the actual path to your directory containing the images.

4. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - After saving the file, make it executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x image_publisher.py
   ```

### **Step 2: Update Package Files**

1. **Update `setup.py`**:
   - Open the `setup.py` file in the root of your package:
  
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test/src/image_processor_test
   gedit setup.py
   ```

   - Modify the `entry_points` section to include the new script:

   ```python
   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'image_publisher = image_processor_test.scripts.image_publisher:main',
       ],
   },
   ```
   - Also modify the `packages` field to the following:
   ```bash
   packages=[package_name, package_name + '.scripts'],
   ```

2. **Rebuild the Workspace**:
   - Navigate back to the workspace root and rebuild:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test
   colcon build
   ```
   **If you get a warning message** like the following:
   ```bash
   Starting >>> image_processor_test
   --- stderr: image_processor_test                   
   package init file 'image_processor_test/scripts/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)
   ---
   Finished <<< image_processor_test [0.54s]

   Summary: 1 package finished [0.69s]
   1 package had stderr output: image_processor_test
   ```
   then run the following few commands to add the `__init__.py` file into the scripts folder:
   ```bash
   touch ~/ros2_ws_test/src/image_processor_test/image_processor_test/scripts/__init__.py
   ```
  This should resolve the issue and you can run the `colcon build` command once more to complete the build of the package.
  
4. **Source the Workspace**:
   - Source the setup file to make sure the new script is available:

   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

### **Step 3: Run the Node**

1. **Run the Image Publisher Node**:
   - Now, you can run the node to start publishing images from the directory:

   ```bash
   ros2 run image_processor_test image_publisher
   ```

   - You should see the node publishing images at the specified interval.

- **Viewing the Images**:
  - If you want to visualize the images being published, you could use a tool like `rqt_image_view`, which can subscribe to the image topic and display the images in real-time.

Open a new terminal tab and run the following:
    ```
    ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
    ```
Select the topic your images are being published on (`/image_topic`, for example) to see the images.
