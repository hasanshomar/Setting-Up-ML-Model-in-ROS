# Create a Subscriber Node**
---
1. **Navigate to Your Package Directory**:
   - Go to the directory where your package is located:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test/src/image_processor_test
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script for the Subscriber**:
   - Inside the `scripts` directory, create a new Python script named `image_subscriber.py`:

   ```bash
   cd image_processor_test/scripts
   touch image_subscriber.py
   ```

3. **Write the Subscriber Node Script**:
   - Open the `image_subscriber.py` file with a text editor:

   ```bash
   gedit image_subscriber.py
   ```

   - Add the following code to create a simple subscriber node that listens to the image topic and processes each incoming image:

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
   from cv_bridge import CvBridge
   import cv2

   class ImageSubscriber(Node):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__('image_subscriber')
           self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
               Image,
               'image_topic',
               self.listener_callback,
               10)
           self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning
           self.bridge = CvBridge()

       def listener_callback(self, msg):
           self.get_logger().info('Receiving image')
           # Convert ROS Image message to OpenCV image
           cv_image = self.bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(msg, "bgr8")

           # Display the image using OpenCV (for visualization purposes)
           cv2.imshow("Received Image", cv_image)
           cv2.waitKey(1)

   def main(args=None):
       rclpy.init(args=args)
       image_subscriber = ImageSubscriber()
       rclpy.spin(image_subscriber)
       image_subscriber.destroy_node()
       rclpy.shutdown()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
   ```

4. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - After saving the file, make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x image_subscriber.py
   ```

5. **Update `setup.py`**:
   - Open the `setup.py` file and add the subscriber node to the `entry_points` section:
  
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test/src/image_processor_test
   gedit setup.py
   ```
   
   ```python
   entry_points={
       'console_scripts': [
           'image_publisher = image_processor_test.scripts.image_publisher:main',
           'image_subscriber = image_processor_test.scripts.image_subscriber:main',
       ],
   },
   ```

6. **Rebuild the Workspace**:
   - Rebuild the workspace to include the new script:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws_test
   colcon build --packages-select image_processor_test
   ```

7. **Source the Workspace**:
   - After building, source the workspace:

   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```


## **Run the Image Publisher Node**:
   - In one terminal, start the image publisher node:

   ```bash
   ros2 run image_processor_test image_publisher
   ```

## **Run the Image Subscriber Node**:
   - Open a new terminal, source the workspace, and run the image subscriber node:

   ```bash
   ros2 run image_processor_test image_subscriber
   ```

## **Visualize the Output**:
   - The subscriber node will receive images published by the publisher node and display them using OpenCV. You should see the images appear in a window as they are received. There might be a slight delay in the visualization due to processing time, however, considering this is simply a visualization tool this should not be an issue going forward.
