# Setting-Up-ML-Model-in-ROS
This repository provides instructions on how to take a Machine Learning Model that is used for 3D concrete print analysis (layer detection and layer height measurement) and implement it into a real-time analysis tool in ROS2 using Ubuntu 22.04.

Here is the sequence of instructions to follow: 
1. (General 1)[https://github.com/hasanshomar/Setting-Up-ML-Model-in-ROS/blob/main/General%20Setup/1.%20Create%20ROS2%20Workspace%20and%20packages.md]
2. (General 2)[https://github.com/hasanshomar/Setting-Up-ML-Model-in-ROS/blob/main/General%20Setup/2.%20Create%20the%20Image%20Processing%20Node%20Script.md]
3. (General 3)[https://github.com/hasanshomar/Setting-Up-ML-Model-in-ROS/blob/main/General%20Setup/3.%20Create%20Image%20Subscriber%20Node.md]
4. (Model Integration)[https://github.com/hasanshomar/Setting-Up-ML-Model-in-ROS/blob/main/ML%20Integration/Integrating%20the%20ML%20model%20into%20ROS%20nodes.md]
